## General Information
### Problem Statement

To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

### Business Objectives

- The business objective is to develop a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) model for accurate melanoma detection, aimed at enhancing the efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility of skin cancer diagnosis. By automating image analysis, the model streamlines the diagnostic process, allowing dermatologists to focus on critical cases, thus accelerating treatment decisions. 
- This initiative aims to improve patient outcomes by facilitating early detection of melanoma, reducing the risk of misdiagnosis, and ensuring timely interventions. Moreover, the scalable nature of the CNN model enables widespread adoption across healthcare facilities, addressing geographic disparities in access to specialized dermatological services. 
- Ultimately, the objective is to leverage technology to mitigate the human error associated with manual diagnosis, providing consistent and objective evaluations of skin lesions to improve diagnostic accuracy and positively impact patient care.


## Conclusions

Despite a slight improvement in validation accuracy, the model's overall accuracy remains unsatisfactory. Further experimentation and potentially an increase in training data are necessary to achieve a high-performing model.
